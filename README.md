This is a random assortment of my solutions, or attempted solutions, for
various coding challenges I have found and attempted.

The languages used vary. Often, I decide to do a challenge in a specific
language only because I am playing with that language at the time.

There should be some work done to clean this up and document the various
files with their purposes.
