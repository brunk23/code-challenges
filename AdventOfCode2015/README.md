These are programs for the challenge at http://adventofcode.com/ for the
year 2015.  I did Day 1 in javascript, right on the page, the rest I am
trying to do in C++.  I went back and recreated a solution for day 1 in
C++, just so I would have a complete working set of code for the whole
challenge.

Some of these certainly have potential errors.

My goal was to complete the entire challenge without help.  For the most
part, I have done that. I did need to research a couple problems more deeply
(Look-and-Say, for example) in order to better understand the problem and
develop my own solution.  The only one where I was completely stumped, and
needed a more direct hint, was day 19 part 2.  I didn't recognize that it
was a context free grammar or the patterns of the data transformations,
until it was explicitely pointed out.  Then I was able to write a program
to find the answer, using the help given.
