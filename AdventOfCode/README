These are programs for the challenge at http://adventofcode.com/ for the
year 2015.  I did Day 1 in javascript, right on the page, the rest I am
trying to do in C++

Some of these certainly have potential errors. I just made the programs
correct enough to work.  I did try and follow good practices.
