10 rem More than one value on the left, this still isn't handled correctly
11 rem and bad code is generated. I need to produce code to test for this
12 rem situation.

13 rem Any of the below should cause a fatal error

20 rem let a 5 = 45
30 rem let b 6 = a
35 rem let a + b = ( 7 + g ) * a / ( 5 - b )
40 rem let a = b = 6

45 rem this one will work

50 let a = ( 7 + g ) * a / ( 5 - b )
