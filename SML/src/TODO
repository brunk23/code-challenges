The compiler should take care to ensure that strings are placed
at the end of all other variables and have a decent amount of
space between each one (50 spots). It should also check to be
sure, when resolving symbols, that a string is not referenced
outside of the string operations (if an unresolved label has
the same symbol and type V, not S, throw the error/warning).
