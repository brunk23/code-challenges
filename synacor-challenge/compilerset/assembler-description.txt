Assembly files will have the following format:
----------------------------------------------
# comments are everything after a #

Labels should be at the start of the line and end with a colon. I would
like to support labels as arguments to a command, so the code can be
self-modifying with wmem, but it's not in place at the moment.  When referenced
you would not use the colon.

label: nop              # all labels and variable names end with
       jmp label
       out foo:		# this does not work but is desired.

Origin is used to set the program counter for code placement purposes.
.origin 00000           # will give an address where the next code goes

Include reads the contents of the file specified on  the line into
the token tree at the place it is read.  If included files have .include
directives, they are not checked to ensure they don't overwrite other code.
.include  "funcs.s"

data:                 # <- is label "data" not a data statement, you should
		      # not do this! But, it would work.

Data commands put the numbers or string directly after them into memory.
    data 0 0 4533 234 99  # everything after a data statement is written directly
    data "Hello"          # will write ascii for "Hello" followed by a 0.

    # registers start with r
