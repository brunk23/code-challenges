Assembly files will have the following format:
----------------------------------------------
# comments are everything after a #

Labels should be at the start of the line and end with a colon. I support
labels as arguments to a command, so the code can be self-modifying with wmem.
When labels are referenced you would not use the colon.

label:  nop                # all labels and variable names end with
        jmp   label
        wmem  foo     r1
        jt    foo:    0	

Origin is used to set the program counter for code placement purposes.
.origin 00000           # will give an address where the next code goes

Include reads the contents of the file specified on  the line into
the token tree at the place it is read.  If included files have .origin
directives, they are not checked to ensure they don't overwrite other code.
It is probably smart to not use .origin in files you intend on including

	.include  "funcs.s"

data:			# <- is label "data" not a data statement, you should
jmp:	jmp	jmp	# not do this! But, it would work. There are no "reserved"
			# words that can't also be labels

Data commands put the numbers or string directly after them into memory.
	data	0 0 4533 234 99  
	data	"Hello\0"	# will write ascii for "Hello" followed by a 0.
				# strings are not null terminated by default

    # registers start with r

add a b c
and a b c
call a
eq a b c
